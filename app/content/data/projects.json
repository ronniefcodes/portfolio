As the viewport resized (and the number of viewable images) changed, the gallery would automatically resize and readjust for the correct page.</p><p>The gallery library hooked into a custom MVC WebAPI that distributed Instagram photos via Tint, expanding on the service's default functionality as well as supporting data caching on our end, avoiding potential API access limit issues.</p><p>The registration form component hooked into a simple database, collecting user entries to be selected from a later date.</p>",
